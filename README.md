 Hi, I’m @AndrewHilditch, I am interested in data science and I work with large datasets and do both cleaning and analysis. I have recently submitted my doctoral thesis and a now looking for a job.
 I work with Python and Julia and I have a past in MATLAB coding as well. I have worked with Network Rail data from their data feeds and have developed network models based on this data.
 
 I can be reached at my email address: ahandrewhilditch@gmail.com.
